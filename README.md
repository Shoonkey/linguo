Hello there!

This is a take on making a dictionary-like web application with a design that feels modern and 
powerful.

### Setting it up on your end

If you want to run this application, make sure you have Node installed. Yarn v1.x.x is also 
recommended but not necessary unless you intend on making a PR out of your fork (in which case it 
can be important to use Yarn so the package lock files don't get all mixed up).

After that, you can just `cd` into each folder and run `npm i` or `yarn` on both to install the
project dependencies. Then, `yarn start` in `client/` will start the front-end interface shenanigan
and `yarn start:dev` in `server/` will get the API server going. 

And that's it! The potatesque dictionnaire should be open and ready to go on your default browser.
